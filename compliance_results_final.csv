**Compliance Checks:**

1. **Valid Leave Type:** We need a mapping of Leave Type codes to actual leave types to verify validity.  Assuming '4' represents a valid leave type (e.g., Paid Time Off, Sick Leave, etc.), this check *passes* for now.  **Requires further clarification.**

2. **Leave Approval Status:**  A status of '2' needs clarification.  Assuming '2' represents ""Approved,"" this check *passes* for now. **Requires further clarification.**

3. **Leave Duration Limits:** 19 days of leave in a month/year.  We need company policy on maximum leave duration per month/year to assess compliance.  This check is *inconclusive* without more information. **Requires further clarification.**

4. **Maternity Leave Eligibility:**  Tenure is 8.6 years, which is well above the 80-day minimum. If the leave type '4' is maternity leave,  the employee is *eligible*. **Requires clarification on Leave Type.**

5. **Data Privacy:** No sensitive data like Aadhaar/bank details are present. This check *passes*.


**Compliance Percentage:**

Based on the available information and assumptions made, the compliance stands at **60%** (3 out of 5 checks pass or are assumed to pass).  Two checks are inconclusive due to missing information.


**Recommendations and Next Steps:**

* **Clarify Leave Type Codes:** Provide a mapping of numeric leave codes to their meanings.  This is crucial for accurate assessment.
* **Clarify Leave Approval Status Codes:**  Define the meanings of different approval status codes.
* **Provide Leave Policy Details:** Share the company policy regarding maximum leave durations (per month/year) and other relevant leave rules.
* **Review Leave Type for Maternity Leave:**  Confirm if Leave Type '4' is maternity leave to finalize eligibility assessment.

By addressing these points, a more accurate and complete compliance analysis can be conducted.

```

**Compliance Checks:**

1. **Valid Leave Type:**  We need a mapping of leave type codes to descriptions to verify validity. Assuming '2' is a valid leave type code, this check *passes*.

2. **Leave Approval Status:**  A status of '2' suggests approved leave. This check *passes*.

3. **Leave Duration Limits:** We need information on the allowed leave days per month/year for this employee's role/department.  The data shows 14 days, but without a limit to compare it to, this check is *inconclusive*.

4. **Maternity Leave Eligibility:** Adriana has worked for 14.9 years, far exceeding the 80-day minimum tenure. If the leave type '2' signifies maternity leave, she is eligible. This check is *likely to pass* but depends on the leave type mapping.

5. **Data Privacy:** No sensitive PII like Aadhaar or bank details are present. This check *passes*.


**Compliance Summary:**

**Overall Compliance Percentage:**

Due to the ""inconclusive"" status of the Leave Duration Limits check and uncertainty about the Leave Type mapping, a precise percentage can't be calculated.  If we assume both these checks eventually pass, then compliance would be 100%.  If one or both fail, the percentage would decrease accordingly. 


**Recommendations:**

* **Provide a Leave Type Mapping:**  A table mapping the leave type codes (e.g., '2') to their descriptions (e.g., 'Sick Leave', 'Vacation', 'Maternity Leave') is needed for complete validation.
* **Define Leave Duration Limits:**  Establish clear policies on the maximum leave days allowed per period (month/year) based on employee role, department, or other relevant factors. This information is crucial for compliance checks.
* **Refine Data Collection:**  While the current data doesn't include sensitive information, be vigilant about data minimization.  Only collect data necessary for leave management and compliance. Regularly review data fields to ensure compliance with privacy regulations.

10326,"## Employee Leave Compliance Analysis

**Valid Leave Types:**  Assuming leave types are coded (1: Sick, 2: Vacation, etc.), we need a mapping to verify. Currently, we can only check if the leave type is an integer.

**Leave Approval Status:** 0 and 1 are assumed to represent Unapproved and Approved, respectively.

**Leave Duration Limits:** Missing information on allowed leave durations per type and period (month/year).  We have ""Total Leave Days"" but no limits to compare against.

**Maternity Leave Eligibility:** We have tenure information (""Total Work Duration""). 80 days is approximately 0.22 years.

**Data Privacy:** No sensitive data like Aadhaar or bank details are present in the provided dataset.

**Analysis Results:**

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Compliance Issues |
|---|---|---|
| 10326 | Michelle Sullivan | * Leave Type validity unknown (Code: 2).<br>* Total leave days (26) exceeds typical limits (assuming a standard limit, which isn't provided).<br>* Further investigation needed regarding the high number of missed deadlines (58 out of 79 tasks). |
| 10326 | Patricia Gilbert | * Leave Unapproved (Status: 0).<br>* Leave Type validity unknown (Code: 1).<br>* High leave frequency (10) warrants attention.<br>* Significant negative leave impact on work (Impact: 1).<br>* Very low team workload ratio (0.075) and high leaves in the team (34 out of 40) for the same period suggest potential team-level issues.|


**Compliance Percentage Calculation:**

Due to missing information (leave type mapping, leave duration limits), a precise compliance percentage cannot be calculated. We can, however, estimate based on the available data. 

Out of the observable factors:

* **Michelle Sullivan:** Potentially non-compliant due to excessive leave duration (assuming a standard limit) and requires investigation for missed deadlines. 
* **Patricia Gilbert:** Non-compliant due to unapproved leave and potential issues related to team workload and leave frequency.

Based on this limited analysis, we can **roughly estimate** a compliance rate of **0%** (since both employees have potential/confirmed issues) within the confines of the provided data. This estimate will likely change with more complete information.



**Recommendations:**

1. **Define Leave Type Codes:** Provide a mapping of leave type codes to descriptions (e.g., 1: Sick Leave, 2: Vacation, etc.).
2. **Establish Leave Duration Limits:** Specify the maximum allowed leave durations per leave type and per period (month/year).
3. **Investigate Leave Approval Process:** Ensure timely leave approval or rejection.  Patricia Gilbert's unapproved leave needs addressing.
4. **Monitor Team Workload and Leave:** Investigate teams with high leave rates and imbalanced workloads (e.g., Patricia Gilbert's team).
5. **Performance Management:** Address performance concerns like Michelle Sullivan's high rate of missed deadlines.

By providing the missing information and addressing the identified issues, we can ensure better leave compliance tracking and management.

**Compliance Percentage:** 40% (2 out of 5 criteria passed)


**Recommendations:**

* **Define Valid Leave Types:** Implement a clear list of leave type codes (e.g., Sick Leave - 1, Vacation - 2, etc.)  to validate leave type compliance effectively.
* **Enforce Leave Approval Process:** Ensure leaves are properly approved before they are taken. The current record shows the leave is not approved.
* **Specify Leave Duration Limits:** Define clear limits for different leave types (e.g., maximum sick leave days per year, maximum vacation days per year, etc.).
* **Maintain Data Privacy:** Continue to avoid storing sensitive personal data like Aadhaar/bank details in the leave records.




**Note:**  The analysis relies on assumptions due to missing information (e.g., meaning of code '0' for Leave Type and Leave Approval Status, units for Total Leave Days).  More comprehensive and clearer data will allow for a more accurate compliance assessment.

```

**Compliance Checks:**

1. **Valid Leave Type:** We need a mapping of Leave Type codes to actual leave types to determine validity.  Assuming '2' represents a valid leave type (e.g., Sick Leave, Vacation), this check *passes*.

2. **Leave Approval Status:** '1' suggests approved status. This check *passes*.

3. **Leave Duration Limits:**  25 days 'Total Leave Days (per month/year)' needs clarification. Is this per month or per year? If it's per month, it's unusually high and likely *fails*.  If it's per year, we need to compare it against the company's annual leave policy to determine compliance. Assuming a standard annual leave policy of around 20-25 days, this would likely *pass* if the value refers to annual leave.

4. **Maternity Leave Eligibility:**  With 14 years of tenure, Amanda surpasses the 80-day minimum requirement.  However, we don't know if this leave is maternity leave. If 'Leave Type 2' IS maternity leave, the check *passes*. If it's NOT maternity leave, this check is *N/A*.


5. **Data Privacy:**  No sensitive data like Aadhaar or bank details are present. This check *passes*.

**Compliance Percentage Calculation:**

Due to the ambiguities around Leave Duration and the nature of Leave Type 2, a precise compliance percentage is difficult.

**Scenario 1: 25 days is annual leave, Leave Type 2 is NOT maternity leave.**

* 4 out of 4 applicable checks pass (Valid Leave Type, Leave Approval Status, Leave Duration, Data Privacy).
* **Compliance: 100%**


**Scenario 2: 25 days is monthly leave, Leave Type 2 is NOT maternity leave.**

* 3 out of 4 applicable checks pass (Valid Leave Type, Leave Approval Status, Data Privacy).
* **Compliance: 75%** (Assuming all checks have equal weight).


**Scenario 3: 25 days is annual leave, Leave Type 2 IS maternity leave.**

* 4 out of 4 applicable checks pass (Valid Leave Type, Leave Approval Status, Leave Duration, Data Privacy, Maternity Leave Eligibility).
* **Compliance: 100%**

**Scenario 4: 25 days is monthly leave, Leave Type 2 IS maternity leave.**

* 3 out of 4 applicable checks pass (Valid Leave Type, Leave Approval Status, Data Privacy, Maternity Leave Eligibility). Leave Duration fails.
* **Compliance: 75%**


**Conclusion:**

Further information is required to accurately assess compliance, particularly regarding:

* **Clarification of ""Total Leave Days"":** Is it per month or year?
* **Mapping of Leave Type codes:** What does ""Leave Type 2"" represent?

Once these points are clarified, a definitive compliance percentage can be calculated.  The current data raises a flag regarding the high number of leave days, especially if it is a monthly value. It warrants further investigation with the employee/manager to understand the reason for the high leave duration. The extremely low task completion rate and high number of missed deadlines (1 task completed out of 60) also raises serious concerns about performance issues and potentially necessitates intervention by HR and the employee's manager.
